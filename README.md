# Hi thereðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my creative space on GitHub!

### I'm a **Multimedia Artist** specializing in game asset creation and environment design, bringing imaginative worlds to life in Blender, Unity and Unreal Engine. My journey is fuelled by creativity, problem-solving, and an insatiable desire to learn in the dynamic field of digital art and game development.

### What I'm learning and makingâš¡
As I learn new techniques and dable in my creations, being it a small 3D exercise or shader, following up to a more complex project, I aim to share my breakthroughs and creative outcomes. I will be exploring 3D game assets workflow for Unity and Unreal, as well any other technique that catch my interest. 

* I aim not to share complex technical insights, as I am not a technical artist by any means, instead I aim to create a repository of ideas and tests/exercizes that might be usefull to any creative in this field. *
* A thank you to all who anonymously helped me in my creative journey! I mean to help you as well. *
